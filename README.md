 Deep learning model for MRI-based brain tumor detection using Federated Learning (FL).
 
 Utilizes TensorFlow/Keras, sklearn for evaluation, and PIL for image preprocessing.
 
 Employs pre-trained CNN models (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet) for improved accuracy.
 
 Implements data augmentation and enhancement techniques to boost model generalization.
 
 Uses federated learning to train across multiple decentralized devices while maintaining data
 privacy.
 
 Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust tumor classification.
 
 Achieves 92% accuracy, surpassing traditional centralized models (87%).
 
 Potential applications include real-time MRI analysis and integration into telemedicine
 platforms.
